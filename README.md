With local Data Science meetups cancelled, I sought to find where in the world has upcoming online meetups on the topic - and find I did! 

Some have some spectacular speaker line-ups, including some of the world's best in natural language processing, image classification systems, reinforcement learning in robotics, forecasting and a lot on more niche topics! - much more variety than I would ever have access to locally.

Many of these meetups are intended for a smallish (<300) audiences, so some are fairly unpolished, which, IMHO, adds to the enjoyment of pilfering through them for hidden teasures, and the kind of frank discussion not possible in wider forums. As PG once [alluded to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mAd5LJFdb4#t=25m43s), after audiences become sufficiently large, speakers will cease speaking frankly:

> "If we ever broadcast them ... speakers would clam up"

So will this renaissance of candid, intellectual discussion persist? Probably not, so check them out while they last! 



# Use

First, install R, and RStudio IDE (both free). Installation time: ~ 2 minutes for both. 

Second, open `meetup.R` with RStudio and set the `topic` variable to something you enjoy - here are [some ideas](https://www.meetup.com/topics/) - copy the topic from the url: whatever comes after 'meetup.com/topics/'.

Last, run the script line by line until the end. In a few minutes, you'll have a curated data.frame of meetups on your topic of choice, their time (in your timezone), as well as links to them and related info!
